Pls DO NOT DISTRIBUTE...

I've checked all this in prematurely so I can work on it some at work and at 
home.

Some of the dprs won't compile on their own yet because they are dependent on 
some OpenGL stuff. I need to make some open source unit versions of the OpenGL 
stuff before I can release this example.
